Things to add/update:
- drawing points with rectangleshape (not required)
- use mouseclick events?
- "You may want to generate more than one point each frame - your fractal will appear faster this way"
- output vertices to the console during input phase or display them as theyre input
- automatically loop the program in main
- extra credit "other cool stuff"


include sfml files
include "points.h"

points inputPoints(points& shape);
void outputPoints(points& shape);

int main()
{
    points triangle(); //empty points object

    //create window, etc

    while (window is open)
    {
    
    //splitting the input and output phase into two functions
    //might be the cleanest way to write main()
    
    inputPoints(triangle); //pass by reference
    - loop checks for escape key to exit
    - prompt user to input points via mouse
    - update triangle object

    void outputPoints(triangle); //pass by reference
    - loop checks for escape key to exit
    - use "triangle.calcNextPoint();" to add a new point to the vector
    - clear window
    - triangle.drawAllPoints(); draw every point

    }

    return 0;
}
